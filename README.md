## 🧮 Algorithm Details

### A* Algorithm
Combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search. Uses both the actual distance from the start (g-score) and a heuristic estimation to the goal (h-score) to efficiently find the optimal path.

**Time Complexity**: O(b^d) where b is the branching factor and d is the depth
**Space Complexity**: O(b^d)
**Optimal**: Yes
**Complete**: Yes

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
A classic algorithm that guarantees the shortest path by exploring all nodes systematically. It works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes ordered by their distance from the start.

**Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V) with priority queue
**Space Complexity**: O(V)
**Optimal**: Yes
**Complete**: Yes

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Explores nodes level by level, visiting all neighbors before moving to the next level. Guarantees the shortest path in unweighted graphs but may explore many unnecessary nodes.

**Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
**Space Complexity**: O(V)
**Optimal**: Yes (for unweighted graphs)
**Complete**: Yes

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Fast but doesn't guarantee the shortest path.

**Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
**Space Complexity**: O(V)
**Optimal**: No
**Complete**: Yes (in finite graphs)

### Greedy Best-First Search
Uses only the heuristic estimation to guide the search towards the goal. Very fast but may not find the optimal path.

**Time Complexity**: O(b^d)
**Space Complexity**: O(b^d)
**Optimal**: No
**Complete**: No

## 🎨 Customization

### Grid Size
Modify the grid dimensions in `components/pathfinding-grid.tsx`:
```typescript
const GRID_ROWS = 20  // Change number of rows
const GRID_COLS = 40  // Change number of columns
```

### Animation Speed
Adjust animation timing in the `visualizePathfinding` function:
```typescript
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10))  // Visited nodes
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 50))  // Path nodes
```

### Start/End Positions
Change default positions in the `PathfindingGrid` component initialization:
```typescript
initialGrid[10][10].isStart = true  // Start position
initialGrid[10][30].isEnd = true    // End position
```
